Noelâ€™s Big Extravaganza Summer: An  Anthology

Money making to big purchases at the store ONG
Going out-ish to far places straight up!!!
Slaving away on a football field 90% of my summer it was HELL
Hanging with my friends through it all 

This summer was something special for lil ol me. This was my first big boy summer to chase that money to spend that same money (i'm broke please help) to go out even more. This was a real step up from my other summers. From consistently staying indoors or just going to practice and doing nothing else I would relive this summer in a heart beat compared to those others. 


Monyuns Chasing

Before summer started my coach told me to sign up for SYEP. I'll be getting paid to go to workouts under him. I'm like oh that sounds fire im gettin paid for stuff i do free i started doing my happy dance. 300-320 every week I was UPPPP, food food food drip drip drip. Those checks were so easy I love SYEP I miss her so much <3. Opened so many opportunities for me during this summer going out and doing the stuff I was able to do.

Exploring/Traveling

Just when summer started me and my friend made a list of a bunch of stuff us and others wanted to do during them summer, consisting of beach day mall day movie day trips etc. Not gonna lie we prolly did like 8/15 things we said we wanted to do. A couple of them were kind of a stretch but we still had fun like this one time we went to Roosevelt Field Mall took forever to get there but fun times all around!

Football Practice ðŸ’”

Previously stated I had to get a job this summer. It was under my coach iâ€™m thinking oh yes! getting paid for doing something i do for free already what could go wrong! Nothing really went wrong but it was just Draininnnng and Boring lowkey burnt out from it but I got that money from it while it lasted then went straight to regular shmegular training for free ðŸ’” but my skills strength and speed went up so thatâ€™s a plus and i got my championship ring another plus and imma starter so pluses all around from my hard work

My BFFS! 

Not gonna lie without my friends my summer would of just been straight practice. It wouldnâ€™t be the same if they werenâ€™t there for all those exploring sand trips we held during the summer. I appreciate and thankful for them being there especially during some of the lowlights of summer they were always there and it was funny, cool, awesome and etc with them always being there. Happy have my goons
