# The Central Park Five: The Case that Exposed the Racial Injustice in America's Legal System.

The story of five boys of color being dragged down because of bias in the legal system because they couldn’t find the real perpetrator.

<p>
In 1989 a group of black and Latino boys was 				
wrongfully accused and locked up of raping a 					
white female jogger in Central Park 5 because of 				
lack of reasoning and evidence, and systemic racial				
bias led the police force and detectives to convict 			
these boys with a story they pulled out of thin air	
and coercion getting the boys to snitch on each 
other not knowing what's going on

## The Effects of Bias

<br>

<br>

•Racial Profiling
-Used when trying to figure out who the person
Was and the boys being in the wrong place
At the wrong time unfortunately was the 
Suspects and them being people of color
The police were destined to incarcerate these
Boys.

•Media interpretation 
-Once the public got ahold of the case they used all types 
of terms to scare the people viewing the case to 
grow an unknown racial fear ‘of black kids,
using terms like wolf pack, “wilding” and much more 
further giving reason for police to lock them up 
to keep society “safe”. 

•Coercement on the boys
-Detectives filled the boys with fear, holding them from eating and sleeping and going home until they used them against each other and made them say a script to get them all incarcerated.

## The Police wasn't looking for Proper Justice they were just trying to find a Perpetrator

### Coercement
Holding the boys for hours by themselves with no adult to represent them and the cops playing mental games on the boys scaring them with being indicted. Preventing these boys to sleep, eat, giving them a second to recooperate, nothing was given easy to these boys, so when they're at their low police decided to execute it officially getting them to sign a paper basically saying they're the true suspects to the crime committed to the jogger.<n>

A little while later the police/detectives got the boys to "confess" and when prosecuted that was their whole case that they got recordings of the boys "confessing" so nypd got the most biased judge to easily lock them up. Even the lawyers of the boys having stronger cases then the lawyers against them, asking for further evidence then just confession tapes that were easily saw through that they were coerced.


### Discrimination
Police saw these boys and didn't hesitate seeing them people of color they immediately started guessing and being predjudice saying they were a "teen gang" labeling them as "wilding", "a wolf-pack" and more. The whole predjucie narrative at the time of this incident was savage minorities were praying on innocent white victims which gave the legal system more drve to get these teens locked up (extending all the way to Donald J Trump to give these boys the Death Penalty.)

When the media got a hold of the story with minorities assaulting white people they got to work straight away making convincing news paper to continue the narrative to stay cautios of people of color.

### Final Effects (Post Prison)
Main problems when readjusting to the new society after being locked up from 5-13 years, were trying to live back a normal life after being labeled a rapist. People didn't treat them like people but as a criminal going back to their original ways, nobody were hiring them so they couldn't make money. The police force and media successfully ruined their lives putting a label upon them and even after fortunately being cleared from their false crime accusation the system took more then ten years to admit its errors (even trump never apologized.)
