# The Central Park Five: The Case that Exposed the Racial Injustice in America's Legal System.

The story of five boys of color being dragged down because of bias in the legal system because they couldn’t find the real perpetrator.

<p>
In 1989 a group of black and Latino boys were 				
wrongfully accused and locked up of raping a 					
white female jogger in Central Park because, of 				
lack of reasoning and evidence, and systemic racial				
bias led the police to force and detectives to convict 			
these boys with a story they pulled out of thin air	because it had to happen this way and no other was possible because these boys were the "criminals" and nothing else
leading to the coercion of getting the boys to tell upon each 
other not knowing what's going on.

## The Effects of Bias

<br>

<br>

•Racial Profiling
-Used when trying to figure out who the person
Was and the boys being in the wrong place
At the wrong time unfortunately was the 
Suspects and them being people of color
The police were destined to incarcerate these
Boys. During the trial they were prejudjed by the trial with little to no evidence stacked upon them they were still founded guilty. 

•Media interpretation 
-Once the public got ahold of the case they used all types 
of terms to scare the people viewing the case to 
grow an unknown racial fear ‘of black kids,
using terms like wolf pack, “wilding” and much more 
further giving reason for police to lock them up 
to keep society “safe”. 

•Coercement on the boys
-Detectives filled the boys with fear, holding them from eating and sleeping and going home until they used them against each other and made them say a script to get them all incarcerated. Telling them all types of lies and filling them with nonsense saying they already lied on eachother and the only way out of here is to tell on them to save their own skins and they didnt even know who they were telling their lies upon. Police taking advantage of their limited knowledge of the legal system not knowing they need a legal representitive to protect them.

## The Police wasn't looking for Proper Justice they were just trying to find a Perpetrator

### Coercement
Holding the boys for hours by themselves with no adult to represent them and the cops playing mental games on the boys scaring them with being indicted. Preventing these boys to sleep, eat, giving them a second to recooperate, nothing was given easy to these boys, so when they're at their low police decided to execute it officially getting them to sign a paper basically saying they're the true suspects to the crime committed to the jogger.
A little while later the police/detectives got the boys to "confess" and when prosecuted that was their whole case that they got recordings of the boys "confessing" so nypd got the most biased judge to easily lock them up. Even the lawyers of the boys having stronger cases then the lawyers against them, asking for further evidence then just confession tapes that were easily saw through that they were coerced.


### Discrimination
Police saw these boys and didn't hesitate seeing them people of color they immediately started guessing and being predjudice saying they were a "teen gang" labeling them as "wilding", "a wolf-pack" and more. The whole predjucie narrative at the time of this incident was savage minorities were praying on innocent white victims which gave the legal system more drve to get these teens locked up (extending all the way to Donald J Trump to sign and give these boys the Death Penalty. "I want to hate these muggers and muderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. I want to hate these murderers and I always will.")
When the media got a hold of the story with minorities assaulting white people they got to work straight away making convincing news paper to continue the narrative to stay cautios of people of color.

### Final Effects (Post Prison)
Main problems when readjusting to the new society after being locked up from 5-13 years, (since Korey was the oldest out of the boys and, back then 16 year olds were valid for proper court convictions apparently given a adult sentence. Korey spent 13 years in a adult prison while the others did 5-6 years in Juvenile.) were trying to live back a normal life after being labeled a rapist. People didn't treat them like people but as a criminal going back to their original ways, nobody were hiring them so they couldn't make money. The police force and media successfully ruined their lives putting a label upon them and even after fortunately being cleared from their false crime accusation the system took more then ten years to admit its errors (even trump never apologized.)
