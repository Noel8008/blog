# I am Starting to get an Obsession with Sneakers

 ### It all started when I was younger
 I would always look at peoples outfits and think “daaaaamn they clean as hell though” meanwhile i'm in my Pumas and champion. Not saying anything is wrong with those types of clothes we all start somewhere plus, momma ain't gonna start dropping blue bills on a kid in elementary -  middle school but even when i was receiving my pumas I knew I wanted my own style and got inspired and would lowkey be a headache to my mother complaining i'm not wearing those and i want this that and the third but main things I would pay attention to is their shoe apparel. I would see my classmates and even my other family members and see Jordan 6s, dunks, Jordan 1s, and when getting older I would see more “exotic” or unique stuff like yeezy, Diors, rick owens, Balanciagas, and more.

### I Need It!!!
I would always be envious when seeing these sneakers and think I can't wait to get money going to have that stuff on 10/10 times. I think my first pair of sneakers that I received from my sisters and I still have them still try to clean them up here and there because they're quite beat but still hold near and dear are my Jordan 12s cool grey would just stare at them and just feel that dopamine rush. Then my second pair was these pink high top dunks also received from my sister (they hurt my feet but i still love them) fresh out of the box my smile wouldn't disappear. Just added to the fuel to the flame that I need more sneakers and I will get them.

### My turn
A couple summers ago I started building my money from summer internships but wouldn't have the chance to buy anything and would have the chance to buy here and there, like some clothes and even bought my first pair of sneakers the jumpman two treys lowkey regret them because they aren't retros but we all start somewhere plus they're not the worst pair i could start off with bought a couple other stuff but not like stuff I would buy now-a-days.

After some time passed I truly educated myself on sneakers and what I like and conversed with other sneaker heads and my friends discussing what's going to be dropping and what's hard and what's not. So during my senior year of high school after my football season ended I had all this free time so I applied myself to get a job in the school. Boyyy when that first couple of paychecks hit I was stalking what was going to be dropping. Then I saw them. The Air Jordan Black Cat 3s. Dropping Jan 11th I decided to ball out that day. Went to the mall and bought some things then I went to the store where I asked them to hold them for me. 200+ dollars later I finally had my first pair that I was ashamed of lol. The full black slick looks just so sexy and clean. I'm just getting started.

this whole year of 2025 is dropping straight diamond pulls. Jordan 5 metallics, Jordan 4 white cements, Jordan 11s gammas and not only Jordan apparel is catching my eyes pink Nocta air forces triple black new balance 9060s and supreme dunks all dropping this year. I am going to be expanding this shoe wardrobe very soon and its going to be maxed out for real. Pray for my pockets. My current rotation is not bad either. I got as previously mentioned My 12s my high top pink dunks jumpmans, and my air forces my new balance 990s metallic dunks adidas campus 00s and crocs <3.

### Its only going to grow
but unfortunately money dont grow on trees and i am going to have to hold my urges back even though they look clean told myself not to get the bred 1s or galaxy Foamposites and even those valentine 3s everything else im gon get is pricey enough taking it slow but will most definitely get those metallic 5s supreme dunks Nocta air forces dunks 9060 new balances gamma 11s white cements 4s and those black cat 4s possible pick ups but most likely not the pure money 3s melo 12s off white jordans 1s fire red 5s legend blue 3s and 11s and many more but again not tryna break the bank. My holy grails that I gotta die with are those off white 5s and bred 11s. Sneakers was always eye-catching to me to this day. I do a double take in the streets seeing stuff i want or stuff i recognize and it's not gonna stop most likely.
